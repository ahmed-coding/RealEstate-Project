# 🧠 Backend Context Analysis Rules

Backend code is provided as contextual information only.

Allowed usage:
- Understanding business intent
- Detecting user roles and permissions
- Improving UI flow and validation feedback

Disallowed usage:
- Re-implementing backend logic in frontend
- Bypassing API behavior
- Guessing undocumented features

API schema remains the source of truth.
